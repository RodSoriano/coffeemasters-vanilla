# Vanilla JS E-Shop

This is a small application to showcase Vanilla JavaScript usage.

This web application is an online store where you can buy different types of coffee, place an order, and input your information so the order can be tracked.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RodSoriano/coffeemasters-vanilla.git
    ```

2. **Install and run a temporary server using `npx serve`:**
    ```sh
    npx serve
    ```
    This will start an on-the-fly server, typically on port 3000.

3. **Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`**
    Now you can enjoy the online store.
